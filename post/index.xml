Short Review  This book covers technical aspects of Blockchain very well, but it was not intended to teach core Blockchain. Although some sections could be ordered for more clarity, the book explains all key aspects very well. Furthermore, the book takes excerpts from many prominent people in the Blockchain community. You can read this as â€œWho is who in Blockchain?</description>

Short Review  If you are a looking for a technical book to learn how Blockchain works, this book will not give you all the details. Small but important details, such as P2P network, hashes and nonces, are not detailed. On the other hand, if you are trying to understand what Blockchain brings and where it can be used, this book is for you.</description>
