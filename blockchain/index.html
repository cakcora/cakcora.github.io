  <h1>Blockchain works</h1>
  
  <h3>4. <a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.04698">Bitcoin Risk Modeling with Blockchain Graphs</a> in Economics Letters </h3>
  <p>We identify certain sub-graphs ('chainlets') that exhibit predictive influence on Bitcoin price and volatility, and characterize the types of chainlets that signify extreme losses.</p>

 
  <h3>3. [Under submission] Blockchain.. </h3>
  <p>Using persistent homology based ideas, we offer an elegant, easily extendable and computationally light approach for graph representation learning on Blockchain networks to predict cryptocurrency prices.</p>

  <h3>2. <a href = "576.pdf">Forecasting Bitcoin Price with Graph Chainlets </a> (PAKDD 2018) </h3>
  <p>We introduce a novel concept of chainlets, or Bitcoin subgraphs, which allows us to evaluate the local topological structure of the Bitcoin graph over time</p>

  <h3>1. Blockchain: A Graph Primer</h3>
  <p>Aug 2017 <a href = "blockchainsurvey1_1.pdf">Version 1.1</a></p>
  <p>We offer a holistic view on Blockchain. Starting with a brief history, we give the building blocks of Blockchain,
and explain their interactions. As graph mining has become a major part its analysis, we elaborate on graph theoretical
aspects of the Blockchain technology</p>
  
  <h3>0. Blockchain Data Sets</h3>
  <p><a href = "https://github.com/cakcora/CoinWorks/blob/master/data.MD">Bitcoin Graph Dataset:</a> We provide annual and monthly data on the Bitcoin graph.</p>
